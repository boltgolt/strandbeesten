# Strandbeesten Simulator

Let this simulator create its own versions of the [strandbeest legs](https://youtu.be/NM4q-f68TlY?t=8s). Only the best performing legs will survive the chain of evolution, with the simulation using a combination of random DNA changes and the “survival of the fittest” principle.
